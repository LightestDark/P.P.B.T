# P.P.B.T

This project is a low-power smart keychain that combines E-paper display technology with NFC, designed to work with minimal energy and remain readable even when completely unpowered.

The system is split into two separate modules:

-E-Paper + NFC Keychain Board

-Solar-Powered DC-DC Booster Board (external, detachable)

**This separation keeps the keychain compact, efficient, and flexible.**


**E PAPER + NFC SCHEMATIC/BOARD/MODEL:**

The e-paper display shows text or graphics and keeps the image with zero power. Power is only needed when the display updates.
The NFC works passively, powered by the reader, allowing phones to scan the keychain even if the battery is empty.

To keep the main board simple and efficient, LED lighting is powered by a separate solar-powered DC-DC booster board. This board takes energy from a small solar panel and boosts it to drive LEDs around the keychain, without affecting the e-paper or NFC system.
